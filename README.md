# Intro to Programming Final Project - Fall 2018

  My game is a typical adventure game, but it has a personal twist. The objective of the game is to determine the yearbook member within a certain number of rounds, or before you die. I made it personal because I used all of the yearbook members at magnet, but then I reallzed that was a ton of coding so I narrowed it down to the juniors who are in that club. It makes more sense that way because those who are going to be playing it are juniors so it would be easier for them to guess their classmates. The goal is to get from UCTech to the yearbook meeting in Magnet. Along the way, you will come across opponents and be given the option to battle them. If youo accept, and you defeat your opponent, you will be given a clue as to who your person is. You will then be prompted to guess after each round. If you are correct, you win, otherwise you get to keep going. You must play strategically because you only have a limited amount of health, so you may not want to battle every opponent ;)
  
  
  The only thing I really want everyone to know is that I had absolutely no coding experience to start with. I mean, none. I decided to work alone to really challenge myself and to ensure I was taking something out of this experience. I did not use any sources other than the notes that were provided to us by Mrs. Gerstein. Oh yeah, I also got some aid from Beatriz. Such a great friend!
